### Final Proposal - Incarceration in the US
1. Data from: https://bjs.ojp.gov/library/publications/census-jails-2005-2019-statistical-tables

2. Project Ideas:
    Map of US, linked maps to each state show statistical data related to local / federal prisons

3. Objectives & Motivation3. Objectives & Motivation
The topic of our intended app is presenting incarceration data for the United States, by state, with data drawn from the Census of Jails:

Â https://bjs.ojp.gov/library/publications/census-jails-2005-2019-statistical-tables


The map will show total incarcerated population figures by state (we have data for 2005, 2013, and 2019) so we will have a way for the user to look at the data across these time periods. The map will have linked displays showing the distribution of the demographic characteristics of incarcerated people by state. Our objective is to allow people to explore the spatial and temporal patterns of incarceration in the US. This is significant against the backdrop of growing prison abolition movements in the US as our visualization may help users find patterns indicating possible injustices regarding who is incarcerated in America. Our target audience is the general public.
